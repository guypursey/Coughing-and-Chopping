# Images

This folder contains any images to be used in the blog. The `.gitignore` file in the parent directory to this one should ensure that it stays empty on the remote repository, but for this README file.

## Usage

### Add a CSV file called `imagemap.csv`

This file will contain comma-delimited key-value pairs and should mostly be handled automatically.
