# Drafts

This folder contains local folders, each of which is a GitHub repository for a piece that is in the process of being written. The `.gitignore` file should ensure that it stays empty on the remote repository, but for this README file.

## Usage

Add a folder, initiate it as a Git repository, start writing and versioning.
