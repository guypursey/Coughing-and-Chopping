# Drafts

This folder contains local folders, each of which is a GitHub repository for a piece that is in the process of being written. The `.gitignore` file in the parent directory to this one should ensure that it stays empty on the remote repository, but for this README file.

## Usage

Run `./newdraft.sh` followed by the name of the piece you are intending to right. This will set up a new folder containing a MarkDown file ready for you to start writing and a file called `tags.txt`.

You can use `tags.txt` to add keywords that you think are relevant to the piece you are writing. Each keyword should be on its own line.
